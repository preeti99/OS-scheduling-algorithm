Ques. 1.   Considering 4 processes with the arrival time and the burst time requirement of the
            processes the scheduler schedules the processes by interrupting the processor after every 3 units
            of time and does consider the completion of the process in this iteration. The schedulers then
           checks for the number of processes waiting for the processor and allots the processor to the
             process but interrupting the processor after every 6 units of time and considers the completion of
             the process in this iteration. The scheduler after the second iteration checks for the number of
             processes waiting for the processor and now provides the processor to the process with the least
            time requirement to go in the terminated state.
      The inputs for the number of requirements, arrival time and burst time should be provided by the
      user.
Consider      the following units for reference.


Process      Arrival time        Burst time                                                                                                    

P1                        0                  18

P2                        2                  23

P3                        4                  13

P4                        13                  10


Ques. 12. Three students (a, b, c) are arriving in the mess at the same time. The id numbers of
these students are 2132, 2102, 2453 and the food taken time from the mess table is 2, 4 and 8
minutes. If the two students have same remaining time so it is broken by giving priority to the
students with the lowest id number. Consider the longest remaining time first (LRTF) scheduling
algorithm and calculate the average turnaround time and waiting time.
